# About this Repository:

<br>

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This project is a personal space where I explore, learn, and document everything related to Machine Learning (ML). Whether you're a beginner or an enthusiast, feel free to browse, contribute, or provide feedback via the [Discussions](https://github.com/yasin-arafat-05/machine_learning/discussions) tab!

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two main folders:

### 1. `note`  
- **Purpose**: Here, I document all the Machine Learning algorithms and concepts in **Bangla (à¦¬à¦¾à¦‚à¦²à¦¾)**.  
- **Goal**: To make ML accessible and understandable for Bengali-speaking learners.  
- **Content**: Notes on algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Ensamble Learning written in a simple and clear way.  


### 2. `code`  
- **Purpose**: This is where I implement the ML algorithms and projects using code.  
- **Goal**: To practice and showcase hands-on coding for ML concepts.  
- **Content**: Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets for various ML tasks.  
- **Example**: Code for training a model, data preprocessing, or visualization.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yasin-arafat-05/machine_learning.git
 ```

2. **Explore the Folders**:  
   - Check `note` for theoretical explanations in Bangla.  
   - Dive into `code` for practical implementations. 

3. **Run the Code**:  
   - Ensure you have Python installed along with libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.  
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to run the scripts.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Contribute
Iâ€™d love for this to be a collaborative space! Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:  
- **Feedback**: Spot a mistake in my notes or code? Let me know in the Discussions tab!  
- **Suggestions**: Have an idea for a new algorithm or project? Share it!  
- **Pull Requests**: Feel free to fork the repo, make changes, and submit a pull request.
